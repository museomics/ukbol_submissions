## Background
The following steps were used to prepare all files needed for submission of genomic skim data generated in UKBOL_Accelerated to the [European Nucleotide Archive (ENA)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home), with the assumption that work is performed from a HPC or unix operating system with full access to all UKBOL pipeline outputs and data. 
Each is desgined based on instructions and requirements set by ENA as under their [ENA metadata model](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/general-guide/metadata.html).

[Where data is missing record "missing: third party data" unless specified otherwise under INSDC Missing Value Reporting Terms](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/samples/missing-values.html)

**4. An install of R (v >4.3.0)**
- This can be on any operating system you like
- Packages: dplyr and plyr

**5. An install of Python (v >3.11)**
- Many scripts (e.g., ENA bulk webin-cli and assess_mitogenomes.py) require python to run (run with Python v3.12.8)

**6. An install of ENA bulk webin-cli**
- This is available for install with associated information [here](https://github.com/enasequence/ena-bulk-webincli/tree/master)

**7. Access to skim2mito outputs**
- This is generated as part of the UKBOL Accelerated pipeline, where [skim2mito](https://github.com/o-william-white/skim2mito) was run on all samples, with outputs sent to a single parent directory called `skim2mito_outputs`

## Sample Registration 

To register all samples - the metadata spreadsheet for all samples has to go through a series of clean-ups and checks: 
- Patch spreadsheet with existing tax IDs
- Patch spreadsheet with any registered tax IDs
- Check for trailing whitespaces and tabs
- Check for valid date and coordinate formatting
- Check for valid country names
- Check for valid species names (if registering new) - Manual assessment and correction of any discrepancies in nomenclature 
- Check for valid tax IDs (if registering new) - In UKBOL Accelerated, tax IDs were searched with [taxid-minting](https://github.com/museomics/taxid-minting-process) and 476 new tax IDs were registered.

These are all done in R with the following R script: [sample_registration.R](https://github.com/museomics/ukbol_submissions/blob/main/sample_registration.R)

### This script is made up of 2 main steps:

  - Step one: prepares metadata spreadsheet for ENA submission requirements by patching the spreadsheet with existing and registered tax IDs and checks for any missing (outputs `missing_taxIDs.csv`)
  - Step two: final checks and formatting for ENA submission. **Outputs:** **(1)** either a list of countries that are incorrectly spelled in the terminal or `character(0)` if all countries are named correctly, **(2)** a final csv of all of the final information (`sample_registration.csv`), **(3)** a TSV for submission online containing samples with lat/lon (`sample_registration.tsv`), and **(4)** a TSV for submission containing only samples without lat/lon (`sample_registration_nolatlon.tsv`).  

**NOTE:** You will notice that at the end samples with no lat/lon metadata are parsed into a separate submission TSV file. This is because ENA treats lat/lon as mandatory fields if the header is present and therefore won't accept missing terms. 

Once the TSVs have been generated you will need to add the following line above the header row: 
```
Checklist	ERC000053:1.6	Tree of Life Checklist
```
And this below the header row 
```
#units										DD	DD						
```
**OR** the following if lat/lon not included: 
```
#units															
```
The TSV files are then ready for submission via the ENA Webin.

## Sequencing read submission 

This information is needed in a single TSV file that can be used to generate a [manifest file](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html). 

|Value| Description |
|---|---|
|study_accession| project accession number|
|sample_accession| Unique sample accession number from ENA - available under Samples > Samples Report | 
|experiment_name| A unique experiment name|
|sequencing_platform| Sequencing platform used. [See ENA permitted values](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html#platform)|
|sequencing_instrument|Sequencing instrument used. [See ENA permitted values](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html#instrument)| 
|library_name|Identifier for library and sequencing run, e.g., Batch01|
|library_source| Source molecule, e.g., `GENOMIC` [See ENA permitted values](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html#source)| 
|library_selection|Library selection, e.g. `RANDOM` [See ENA permitted values](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html#selection), 
|library_strategy|Sequencing strategy, e.g., whole genome sequencing (`WGS`). [See ENA permitted values](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/reads/webin-cli.html#strategy), 
|library_description| Unique descriptor for library| 
|"uploaded file 1"|Gzipped forward filepath - `uploaded.file.1`|
|"uploaded file 2"|Gzipped reverse filepath - `uploaded.file.2`| 


**To generate that TSV:**

1. CSV: ENA registered sample metadata - this can be downloaded directly from the ENA webin site (must contain at minimum sample accession (`sample_accession`) and unique sample name - in this case we use `sample_alias`) 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/museomics/ukbol_submissions/blob/main/img/ENA_sample_download.png" width="400" height="300"
    alt="ENA Webin Sample metadata download">
</p

2. CSV: Sequence filepaths - this must have a minimum of 3 columns, unique sample name (`sample_alias`), forward read filepath (`uploaded.file.1`) and reverse read filepath (`uploaded.file.2`)

To generate the TSV run the R code [submit_reads.R](https://github.com/museomics/ukbol_submissions/blob/main/submit_reads.R)- where you change defined variables according to needs.

Once this TSV is generated, it can be **validated** and then **submitted** to ENA via the [ena bulk webincli tool](https://github.com/enasequence/ena-bulk-webincli/tree/master).
This tool takes the TSV and generates individual manifests before submitting the manifests and sequence data to ENA. 

To validate the TSV and generate the manifests the command would look like the following: 
```
python /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/bulk_webincli.py -u Webin-XXXXX -p XXXXXX -g reads -s sequence_submission.tsv -m validate -d UKBOL_accelerated --webinCliPath /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/webin-cli-9.0.1.jar
```

**NOTE** You will have to specify the filepath to bulk_webincli.py based on where your install is. You will also have to specify your webin login details (`-u` and `-p` for username and password). The argument `-d` specifies the parent directory of your files to be uploaded
To submit the manifests run change `-m validate` to `-m submit`: 

```
python /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/bulk_webincli.py -u Webin-XXXXX -p XXXXXX -g reads -s sequence_submission.tsv -m submit -d UKBOL_accelerated --webinCliPath /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/webin-cli-9.0.1.jar
```

## Mitogenome assembly submissions

**Mitogenome successes**

Mitogenome success and submission strategy was assessed by contiguity, length and circularity of final scaffold:

|Category|Submission Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|Complete mtDNA chromosome| [Chromosome-level assembly](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly/genome.html) |considered complete if circularised by getOrganelle in [the skim2mito run used to generate the data](https://github.com/o-william-white/skim2mito)|
|Partial mtDNA chromosome | [Chromosome-level assembly](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly/genome.html)| A single, non-circularised scaffold of minimum length of 5kbp|
|mtDNA assembly| [Contig-level assembly](https://ena-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submit/assembly/genome.html)| Multi-contig assembly, where a minimum of 5 protein-coding genes are present per contig|

> All submissions are taxonomically validated to ensure no contamination
> Any assemblies with gene duplications are removed

To assess this, the [assess_mitogenomes.R](https://github.com/museomics/ukbol_submissions/blob/main/assess_mitogenomes.R) tool. This is a script that contains a function that requires a single argument - the parent directory where all skim2ribo outputs are found. This can be run by sourcing the script to load the function and then running it with the right filepath: 

```
source(assess_mitogenomes.R)
assess_mitogenomes("/path/to/dir")
```

This function outputs:
1. A csv of all multi-contig assemblies that are eligible for submission
2. A csv of all partial mitochondrial genome assemblies that are eligible for submission
3. A csv of all complete mitochondrial genome assemblies that are eligible for submission
4. A summary of the total number of each type of assembly
5. A text file of valid contigs for each multi-contig sample

The script [parse_contig_assemblies_fun.sh](https://github.com/museomics/ukbol_submissions/blob/main/parse_contig_assemblies_fun.sh) is then run on the output text files to filter out any contigs that are less than 5kbp, have been flagged as contaminant or contain multiple gene copies and to output final FASTA and matching BED (annotation) files. The shell script is a function and can be run as follows:

```
chmod +x parse_contig_assemblies_fun.sh
./parse_contig_assemblies_fun.sh . ./parsed_files
```



**Mitogenome submissions**

To submit mitogenomes the following is required: 
1. Manifest metadata
2. A GZIP compressed FASTA file
3. A TSV of filepaths associated with each sample accession


To get the filepaths for every skim2mito generated assembly run the following: 

```
ls skim2mito_output/*/assembled_sequence/*.fasta.gz | awk -F'/' '{name=$NF; sub(/\.fasta$/, "", name); print $0 "\t" name}' > fasta_files_with_basenames.tsv
```

To link the manifest metadata required, the filepaths and associated sample accessions, the R script [assembly_submissions.R]() was run as follows: 

```

```

Final assembly manifests were then submitted to ENA using a [modified version of the bulk_webincli.py tool](https://github.com/Kamouyiaraki/ena-bulk-webincli_primary_assembly) using the following: 

```
python /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/bulk_webincli_primary_assembly.py -u Webin-XXXXX -p XXXXXX -g reads -s assembly_submission.tsv -m validate -d UKBOL_accelerated --webinCliPath /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/webin-cli-9.0.1.jar
python /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/bulk_webincli_primary_assembly.py -u Webin-XXXXX -p XXXXXX -g reads -s assembly_submission.tsv -m submit -d UKBOL_accelerated --webinCliPath /path/to/ena-bulk-webincli/webin-cli-9.0.1.jar
```
